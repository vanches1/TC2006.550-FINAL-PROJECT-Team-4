-> Project description


-> Programming language 

Previous research has shown that Elixir has multiple modules or libraries in which image processing can be performed. For this reason, this programming language was chosen as the primary tool.       

-> Expected solution

Recalling the basic principles of digital image processing, a digital image is an array, or rather a matrix, containing the colour intensity information of each of the pixels present in the image.  
By means of the implementation of some operators or algorithms, it is intended to modify the information of each of the pixels present in the image in order to obtain a new one. 
For this reason, in order to fulfill the objective of this project, we seek to create an algorithm that is capable of opening an external image and converting all the information on the intensity of its pixels into an array that will later be modified with different methods to generate a new image.
The appearance of this new image depends directly on the operations applied to the array containing the information of each pixel. For example, if this matrix is multiplied by a scalar, all the elements would increase in value, which in terms of the image would translate into pixels with a higher intensity or rather a more saturated image.

Within this discussion forum of the elixir programmers community a list of the best libraries for image processing is listed. In this list stands out the library named "mogrify", it is clear that the features of this library make it a very competent tool for image processing.

 
In addition to having an extensive documentation of each of its functions.
